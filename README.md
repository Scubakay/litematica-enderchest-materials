# Litematica Enderchest Materials

Tired of having to completely fill your inventory while preparing for a build with Litematica? Of putting your stuff in your ender chest after painstakingly ignoring everything you collected, only to have it reset after reloading your chunks? Then this mod is for you!

## What is it?

This is an addon for Litematica that adds your ender chest inventory to the material list availabilty. Just put everything you need in your ender chest and Litematica will show you everything you collected in your ender chest too!

## How does it work?

To add the materials in your ender chest to the availability you need to open your ender chest at least once after entering a world or server. After that, it will update every time you add or remove something in your ender chest! This is because the Minecraft client normally does not have the ender chest inventory stored. 

If you have any other problems, please let me know in the issue tracker. This mod is very early in development, but it should all work!
