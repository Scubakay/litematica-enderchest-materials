# Litematica Enderchest Materials

An addon for Litematica that adds your Enderchest inventory to the material list.

Somehow the Enderchest inventory is always empty before you open it at least once, so
the inventory is being cached. That means you will always need to open your Enderchest
before checking out your material list.

## This mod is in Alpha. Please let me know if you encounter any bugs!
